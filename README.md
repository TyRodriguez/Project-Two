# Restaurateur
Menu hosting app targeted for small businesses that allows for restaurant owners to upload their menu online at no cost.

## Description of Application
While the current online options for restaurant owners are plentiful, they focus on photographs, ratings, or delivery. 
Getting the most up-to-date menu information for small restaurants is difficult, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Many restaurants are working with a shortened staff and are limited with resources, which makes getting their information online even more difficult. 

Restaurateur allows for restaurant owners to log into our website and upload the restaurant name, address, hours, phone number, menu items, item descriptions, and item costs. 
Restaurateur provides a link to a restaurantâ€™s menu that owners can use in place of a website for different search engines, such as Google or Yelp.

## User Story
